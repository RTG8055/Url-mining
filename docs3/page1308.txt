can t get vehicular access to the car park until pm that day ', ' really nice clean budget room cupcakes we re waiting for us on arrival food in the pub was lovely too big shout out to tbf cleaner such a lovely lady ', ' june ', ' terrible nights sleep the bed was awful very uncomfortable the mattress was thin and springy the sheets were too small and weren t tucked under so you were often left facing the plastic mattress cover you only get pillow that is so thin and lumpy you might as well not have one the windows aren t double glazed or insulated so you not only get a breeze but also a lot of noise throughout the night which if you re a light sleeper like me will keep waking you up we were here for nights and got no fresh towels or bedding our wet towels were piled on top of each other messily by housekeeping on the radiator you don t get enough toiletries shampoo and shower gel for two people and they didn t restock them after the first night so we had to go buy some the i kettle is placed on a shelf below the tv but it doesn t reach any plug socket so you have to boil the kettle on the floor we weren t expecting luxury but we were after a good nights sleep which we found impossible the place could be so much better if they invested in new mattresses fitted sheets fresh towels and toiletries ', ' free parking although there aren t many spaces but we were lucky to get one each day spacious bathroom nice shower decent location tesco next door and nice restaurants pubs in the area ', ' may ', ' room ', ' not much ', ' may ', ' i was kept awake until am with the disco roaring so loudly the dj might as well have set up his decks in our room extremely loud yes it does mention there is a free dj but am on booking com but it doesn t mention you won t be able to sleep
