of u shares u discounts u were u more u likely u to u widen u than u narrow ', ' u we u monitor u discounts u to u navs u considering u the u weighted u average u discount u across u the u sector u as u a u whole u and u we u screen u trusts u at u an u individual u level u by u setting u target u discounts u at u which u we u would u buy u or u sell u he u said u alongside u full year u results u

have u the u effect u of u limiting u the u discount ', ' u while u spiller u has u been u hunting u for u investment u trust u opportunities u where u the u threat u of u discount u downside u may u be u more u limited u the u other u obvious u response u to u an u expensive u sector u is u to u sell u holdings u when u they u seem u too u pricey ', ' u he u has u been u doing u that u too u the u manager u said u he u had u been u attracted u to u some u of u the u infrastructure u launches u of u the u past u year u offering u prospective u real u returns u in u low u single u digits u with u significantly u lower u risk u than u the u equity u markets ', ' u we u have u participated u in u a u number u of u these u issues u he u said u in u most u instances u the u funds u have u

he u said ', ' u given u this u extremely u defensive u positioning u we u were u delighted u not u to u mention u surprised u that u the u portfolio u delivered u u return u over u the u year ', ' u spiller u said u this u was u primarily u due u to u the u weakness u of u the u pound u following u the u uk s u vote u to u leave u the u european u union u and u the u boost u that u provided u to
