you ve already been convinced to stump up for a battery powered brush it s difficult to choose the best electric toothbrush when the brushes all look nigh on identical and the adverts bombard you with pseudo science and marketing speak rest assured we ve done our homework to help you pick the toothbrush that s right for you ', ' all the models here will get your teeth squeaky clean but they vary widely in terms of brushing technology battery life accessories extra functions and price do you want a toothbrush that gives detailed real time feedback via your smartphone do you want a choice of brush heads do you need a charging travel case or do you just want a simple model that gets the job done we ve got them all covered so read on to find your ideal model ', ' read next our guide to the best hair dryers you can buy ', ' an electric toothbrush might many times more than a standard human powered brush but buying a good one can dramatically improve the quality of your brushing and it ll hopefully stop your dentist moaning at you everytime you visit too these are all the features and functions to look out for when buying a new brush ', ' while it might be tempting to opt for the cheapest electric toothbrush you can find not all are created equal the bottom rung models often use aa batteries and while being able to use your own replaceable rechargeable batteries may seem like a more practical choice these low end models have lower powered motors which oscillate at a much slower rate than ones equipped with dedicated non removable batteries this means that their brushing performance is much worse than models with more powerful motors and in some cases you may be better off with a standard unpowered toothbrush than a cheap electric one spending more on a model with a dedicated and generally non removable battery will reward with much improved brushing abilities ', ' regardless of the price the most important issue is how well they brush oral b and philips are the market leaders and we found that at least amongst the brushes we ve reviewed here and at comparable price points there s no significant difference in the overall quality of the brushing experience between the two brands ', ' the feel of the two brands brushing technology couldn t be more different though philips using tiny extremely fast vibrations that feel like they re rattling food stains and plaque off your teeth oral b uses a slightly slower larger movement and the toothbrush head rotates rather than vibrates both systems do an excellent job and they re more effective than manual brushing especially for hard to reach areas where there s not much room for manoeuvre ', ' more upmarket toothbrushes also include various extra modes such as whitening gum care and sensitive but most of these only vary the motor speed a little or pulse the motor speed up and down to attempt to loosen hard to reach plaque and bits of food we don t see these as must have features though on balance we prefer oral b s approach particularly with its array of different brush head types for different priorities i e reaching between teeth or polishing more effectively but that s a subjective rather than scientific analysis ', ' bundled extras such as travel cases do come in handy and especially so if the toothbrush can be charged in the case using a usb cable it s one fewer charger to carry ', ' another important factor is whether your toothbrush is ready to use when you need it it s no use if the battery runs out regularly and without warning the lithium ion batteries found in pricier models are a step up from the nickel metal hydride often labelled ni mh ones on cheaper brushes this is because the lithium ion cells as they can be topped up at any time whereas the ni mh ones need to be depleted fully before charging if you don t want to reduce their lifespan and capacity ', ' electric toothbrushes encourage you to have good brushing habits letting you know when you ve completed two minutes of brushing the oral b models also warn you when you re pressing too hard and risking damage to your gums thanks to leds which pulse and flash when you re putting too much pressure on your gnashers ', ' the bluetooth enabled models go further still by adding companion apps that time your brushes keep a diary of your activity provide oral hygiene tips and snippets of news and make you feel guilty for missing brushes not flossing enough and so on these kind of features are fun but they re by no means essential and you can expect the novelty to wear off pretty quickly it s also highly reliant on the quality of the apps themselves given that their more advanced features rely on your smartphone camera to track where and how you re brushing they might not be compatible with everyone s brushing techniques if you re a head down brusher or just like to roam the bathroom while polishing your gnashers you ll get very little benefit from a bluetooth connected brush ', ' this can be a confusing experience but these days you ll find that most modern philips and oral b toothbrushes make buying replacement heads a relatively simple affair ', ' all of oral b s current heads work on their entire range of brushes except their sonic toothbrush range which require dedicated sonic compatible heads as oral b makes several different designs of head however it s worth buying smaller twin packs to decide which you like best their crossaction flossaction and precisionclean heads all feel quite different in use ', ' philips also has a range of different types of brush head each with their own specialist designs but all the current range are interchangeable one thing worth mentioning is that you can also find mini sized versions of the various heads for smaller mouths or for more accurate cleaning around braces and other orthodontic treatments ', ' we ve included links to the various types of heads below so you can stock up when you run out or just have a look at the alternative brush head types ', ' price when reviewed ', ' ', ' image of ', ' ', ' this is the entry level model in philips sonicare range but you still get the same high speed brushes per second as per pricier models it s a strange sensation but clearly effective and teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing the battery lasted for an astonishing brushes between charges although this was tested over a short period of time expect less when used twice daily there was plenty of notice when it came close to running out of charge so you re unlikely to be caught short because it has a lithium ion battery you can charge at any time rather than having to wait until it s fully depleted before charging ', ' there s only one brush head included and sadly no travel case you could pick up a case separately for around but it won t necessarily be a snug fit that may be enough reason to reject this toothbrush if you re not put off by this the philips sonicare easyclean is a superb electric toothbrush at a great price ', ' read our philips sonicare easyclean hx review ', ' key specs cleaning modes battery type li ion battery accessories included brush head head cap charger battery life

cleaning experience is top notch with a choice of rotating brush head designs that make teeth feel really smooth and clean and a warning indicator when there s too much pressure we got brushes from a single charge but the ni mh battery may not perform as well as the genius s lithium ion battery in the long run ', ' there s lots of kit in the box including four brush heads a plain looking travel case a brush head holder and a wireless smartguide module this little waterproof unit sits on the bathroom shelf to provide a timer that advises you to brush each corner of the mouth for seconds at the end it rewards you with a smiley face connect to a smartphone via bluetooth and you get all this and more including brushing tips usage history and a news feed but not the face tracking mode found

something pretty special fortunately the oral b genius delivers ', ' for starters it gives a really thorough clean we particularly like the d white brush head with its plastic polishing cup and the flossaction head that s designed to give a deep clean between teeth the handle gives a choice of six brush modes and warns when there s too much pressure unlike other oral b toothbrushes this one uses a li ion battery so you can charge it at your convenience it lasted for brushes on a single charge ', ' it connects via bluetooth to your phone giving real time feedback of brushing an activity diary and gentle chastisement when you miss a brush or finish too early it can even use the phone s camera to make sure you re brushing each area sufficiently it s quite entertaining and educational but we suspect the novelty will wear off ', ' the box includes a suction based phone holder four brush heads and a sleek travel case that doubles as a charger this uses a two pin adapter the integrated usb socket is for charging other devices but you can t charge the toothbrush via usb given that s our only major complaint it s fair to say that the genius is an otherwise outstanding electric toothbrush
