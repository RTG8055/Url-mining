[' u by u anthony u lane ', ' u june u u ', ' u and u there u came u from u the u land u of u britain u a u prophet u whose u name u was u jeremy u and u he u cried u aloud u in u the u wilderness u and u said u behold u i u bring u you u hope ', ' u and u it u came u to u pass u in u the u land u of u britain u that u the u high u priestess u went u unto u the u people u and u said u behold u i u bring u ye u tidings u of u great u joy u for u on u the u eighth u day u of u the u sixth u month u there u shall u be u a u general u election ', ' u and u the u people u said u not u another u one ', ' u and u they u waxed u wroth u against u the u high u priestess u and u said u didst u thou u not u sware u even u unto u seven u times u that u thou u wouldst u not u call u a u snap u election ', ' u and u the u high u priestess u said u i u know u i u know u but u brexit u is u come u upon u us u and u i u must u go u into u battle u against u the u tribes u of u france u germany u and u sundry u other u holiday u destinations u and u i u must u put u on u the u armor u of u a u strong u majority u in u the u people u s u house u therefore u go u ye u out u and u vote ', ' u and u there u came u from u the u temple u pollsters u who u said u surely u this u woman u will u flourish u for u her u enemy u is u as u grass u she u cutteth u him u down u he u is u as u straw u in u the u wind u and u he u will u blow u away u and u the u trumpet u of u her u triumph u shall u sound u in u all u the u land ', ' u and u the u high u priestess u said u piece u of u cake ', ' u and u there u came u from u the u same u country u a u prophet u whose u name u was u jeremy u his u beard u was u as u the u pelt u of u beasts u and u his u raiments u were u not u of u the u finest u and u he u cried u aloud u in u the u wilderness u and u said u behold u i u bring u you u hope ', ' u and u suddenly u there u was u with u him u a u host u of u young u people u and u he u said u unto u them u ye u shall u study u and u grow u wise u in u all u things u and u i u shall u not u ask u ye u for u gold u and u the u sick u shall u be u made u well u and u they u also u will u heal u freely u and u he u promised u unto u them u all u manner u of u goodly u things ', ' u and u the u young u people u said u unto u him u how u shall u these u things u be u rendered u seeing u that u thou u hast u no u money u in u thy u purse ', ' u and u he u spake u unto u them u in u a u voice u of u sounding u brass u and u said u soak u the u rich u and u again u pull u down u the u mighty u from u their u seats ', ' u and u the u young u people u went u absolutely u nuts ', ' u and u they u hearkened u unto u the u word u of u jeremy u and u believed u for u they u said u unto u themselves u lo u he u bringeth u unto u us u the u desire u of u our u hearts u he u cometh u by u bicycle u with u a u helmet u upon u his u head u and u he u eateth u neither u flesh u nor u fowl u according u to u the u scriptures u for u man u cannot u live u by u bread u alone u but u hummus u is u quite u another u matter ', ' u and u the u high u priestess u saw u all u these u things u and u was u sore u and u she u gathered u unto u her u the u chief u scribes u and u the u pharisees u and u said u unto u them u what u the u hell u is u going u on ', ' u and u they u said u unto u her u it u is u a u blip u as u if u it u were u a u rough u place u upon u the u road ', ' u but u they u said u unto u themselves u when u the u government u was u upon u her u shoulders u this u woman u was u mighty u but u now u that u she u has u gone u abroad u unto u every u corner u of u the u land u she u stumbleth u for u surely u it u is u written u that u ruling u and u campaigning u are u as u oil u and u water u and u there u shall u be u no u concord u betwixt u them ', ' u and u the u chief u scribes u wrote u upon u tablets u saying u jeremy u is u false u of u tongue u he u hideth u wickedness u in u his u heart u and u his u sums u do u not u add u up ', ' u and u nobody u paid u any u attention ', ' u and u the u elders u rose u up u and u said u to u the u young u people u if u ye u choose u jeremy u he u will u bring u distress u in u your u toils u and u wailing u upon u your u streets u do u ye u not u remember u the u nineteen seventies ', ' u and u the u young u people u said u the u what ', ' u and u the u elders u spake u again u and u said u to u the u young u people u beware u for u he u gave u succor u in u days u of u yore u to u the u i r a ', ' u and u the u young u people u said u the u what ', ' u and u the u young u people u said u jeremy u shall u bring u peace u unto u all u nations u for u he u hateth u the u engines u of u war u that u take u wing u across u the u heavens u and u he u showeth u respect u for u all u peoples u even u unto u the u transgender u community ', ' u and u the u elders u said u the u what ', ' u and u it u came u to u pass u that u the u heathen u of u this u land u came u among u the u people u with u fire u and u sword u and u slew u many u among u the u faithful u and u great u was u the u lamentation ', ' u and u the u high u priestess u waxed u exceeding u wroth u and u said u to u the u people u fear u not u for u i u shall u bind u your u wounds u and u give u ye u shelter u from u the u heathen u and u shall u take u up u the u sword u against u them ', ' u and u there u came u again u pollsters u from u the u temple u who u said u will u the u people u not u vote u for u her u in u this u hour u of u need ', ' u and u nobody u paid u any u attention ', ' u and u it u came u to u the u vote ', ' u and u the u elders u went u up u to u vote u and u the u young u people u and u the u young u people u were u as u a u multitude u and u in u the u hours u of u darkness u there u was u much u counting u and u the u young u people u watched u by u night u and u the u elders u went u to u bed ', ' u and u there u came u in u the u morning u news u that u the u high u priestess u had u vanquished u the u prophet u jeremy u but u the u triumph u of u the u high u priestess u was u as u the u width u of u a u nail u and u she u was u vexed ', ' u and u the u elders u and u the u chief u scribes u and u the u pharisees u spoke u among u themselves u yea u even u in u the u corners u of u their u houses ', ' u and u there u was u great u rejoicing u amidst u the u multitude u of u the u young u and u they u took u strong u wine u and u did u feast u among u themselves u and u there u were u twelve u baskets u left u over ', ' u and u of u the u pollsters u there u was u no u sign ', ' u and u the u people u saw u jeremy u and u said u surely u this u man u has u won u doth u he u not u skip u in u gladness u like u a u young u hart u upon u the u hills ', ' u and u there u was u great u murmuring u among u the u elders u and u they u said u unto u themselves u weep u not u for u the u high u priestess u doth u but u prepare u the u way u cometh u there u not u one u who u is u greater u than u she ', ' u and u they u said u behold u for u the u hour u of u the u redeemer u is u upon u us u and u his u name u shall u be u called u wonderful u counsellor u the u prince u of u peace u and u they u cried u in u one u voice u boris ', ' u and u the u young u people u said u oh u shit ', ' u and u the u people u gave u tongue u and u made u supplication u unto u the u lord u saying u lord u let u our u cry u come u unto u thee ', ' u and u the u lord u thought u the u whole u thing u was u absolutely u hilarious ', ' u and u then u the u people u said u lord u what u shall u we u do u regarding u brexit u for u henceforth u the u high u priestess u shall u be u as u weak u as u a u newborn u lamb u how u shall u we u hope u for u continued u access u to u the u single u market ', ' u and u the u lord u said u the u what ', ' u anthony u lane u
