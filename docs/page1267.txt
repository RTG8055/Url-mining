[' ', ' u thursday u u june u u ', ' u chiara u ceci ', ' u rspb u contributor ', ' u no u doubts u about u it u puffins u are u my u favourite u birds u every u time u i u visit u a u puffin u colony u i u always u take u hundreds u of u photos u even u if u i u have u thousands u of u them u pictures u of u these u funny u looking u birds u take u a u good u percentage u of u the u memory u of u my u phone u and u of u my u computer u with u their u colourful u bills u and u eye u markings u puffins u are u a u great u subject u for u every u photographer u even u for u an u amateur u like u me ', ' u what u if u i u told u you u that u scientists u need u us u to u send u them u our u pictures u of u puffins u i u am u very u excited u to u announce u that u today u we u are u launching u a u new u citizen u science u project u about u puffins u this u summer u at u the u rspb u we u are u asking u visitors u to u puffin u colonies u across u the u uk u and u ireland u to u help u us u with u an u important u research u we u need u you u to u become u u puffarazzi u u and u take u photographs u of u the u birds u carrying u fish u in u their u bills ', ' u in u recent u years u puffins u numbers u across u the u uk u and u europe u have u plummeted u leading u to u the u species u being u declared u vulnerable u to u global u extinction u u with u further u declines u of u between u u percent u projected u by u u warming u seas u caused u by u climate u change u affect u puffins u u food u sources u and u are u thought u to u be u the u main u threat u to u their u survival ', ' u we u need u to u find u out u more u about u the u causes u of u this u decline u and u my u colleague u dr u ellie u owen u conservation u scientist u at u the u rspb u centre u for u conservation u science u has u started u this u project u to u do u just u that u she u is u our u puffarazzo in chief ', ' u we u are u still u uncertain u why u puffins u are u in u decline u but u there u is u evidence u that u lack u of u food u to u raise u chicks u could u be u a u key u issue u as u we u witness u worryingly u high u breeding u failures u at u some u key u colonies u over u recent u years u we u need u to u find u out u more u about u what u puffins u feed u to u their u chicks u and u we u need u people u s u help u for u this u project u we u know u that u there u is u great u affection u for u these u birds u and u this u project u will u give u everyone u the u chance u to u be u part u of u the u work u being u done u to u save u them ', ' u puffarazzi u is u the u citizen u science u element u of u project u puffin u uk u this u innovative u project u funded u by u the u national u lottery u the u heritage u lottery u fund u hlf u combines u the u latest u technology u with u citizen u science u to u tackle u three u of u the u biggest u challenges u hampering u conservation u efforts u for u these u charismatic u birds u discovering u more u about u what u puffins u feed u their u chicks u where u they u go u to u find u food u and u how u their u numbers u are u changing ', ' u four u easy u steps u to u become u a u puffarazzo ', ' u u visit u a u puffin u colony u in u june u and u july u to u get u a u true u picture u of u what u puffins u feed u their u chicks u we u need u pictures u from u puffin u colonies u across u the u uk u try u and u visit u between u early mid u june u and u mid late u of u july u which u is u main u period u when u puffins u are u feeding u their u chicks u and u therefore u carrying u fish u outside u these u times u you u will u not u see u any u fish u being u carried u and u each u colony u has u slightly u different u timing u so u plan u your u timing u to u give u you u the u best u chance u to u coincide u with u puffins u carrying u fish u here u are u some u suggestions u of u rspb u sites u you u could u visit u www rspb org uk puffins u have u a u look u at u the u map u of u uk u puffin u colonies u on u the u project u webpage u www rspb org uk projectpuffin ', ' u u find u a u mama u or u papa u puffin u we u know u puffins u are u gorgeous u birds u and u any u picture u of u a u puffin u is u special u but u for u this u research u we u just u need u to u see u the u fish u in u the u puffins u u bill u so u try u to u look u at u birds u that u are u breeding u and u have u chicks u to u feed u avoid u getting u close u to u the u puffin u burrows u you u just u need u to u see u puffins u carrying u fish u from u a u safe u distance u and u be u ready u with u your u camera ', ' u u prepare u your u camera u and u snap u the u easiest u way u to u get u a u photo u is u to u spot u puffins u that u have u landed u and u are u holding u fish u we u know u it u can u be u very u hard u to u get u a u flying u bird u in u focus u but u if u you u have u a u camera u with u a u fast u tracking u mode u you u may u also u be u able u to u take u photos u of u puffins u flying u with u fish u whilst u you u perfect u your u photography u skills u you u might u snap u an u image u that u could u provide u us u with u a u lot u of u information u before u you u take u part u please u make u sure u you ve u read u the u photography u guidelines u as u they ll u keep u the u puffins u and u you u safe ', ' u u upload u your u photos u all u aspiring u puffarazzi u should u submit u their u pictures u at u www rspb org uk projectpuffin u we u will u need u to u know u where u you u took u the u picture u and u the u date u and u exact u time u so u make u sure u to u take u note u of u that u this u is u very u important u information u for u the u research u and u will u allow u us u to u map u the u findings u on u the u different u seabird u colonies u in u the u uk u and u get u the u first u nation wide u snapshot u of u what u puffin u are u eating u which u may u help u to u explain u why u some u puffin u colonies u are u declining u while u others u are u doing u better u note u that u all u photos u must u have u been u taken u this u year u for u this u project only u send u one u picture u of u each u bird u you u photograph u choose u the u one u you u think u shows u the u fish u most u clearly u and u it u doesn u t u matter u how u much u fish u your u puffin u has u and u keep u the u others u for u your u collection u if u we u receive u multiple u photos u of u one u bird u it u will u bias u our u data ', ' u when u you u submit u a u photo u we u ll u ask u you u if u you u to u provide u us u with u your u
