[' loading ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' working ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' working ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' a theory postulated by the biochemist peter mitchell in to describe atp synthesis by way of a proton electrochemical coupling accordingly hydrogen ions protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space via the hydrogen carrier proteins while the electrons are transferred along the electron transport chain in the mitochondrial inner membrane as the hydrogen ions accumulate in the intermembrane space an energy rich proton gradient is established as the proton gradient becomes sufficiently intense the hydrogen ions tend to diffuse back to the matrix where hydrogen ions are less via the atp synthase a transport protein as the hydrogen ions diffuse through the atp synthase energy is released which is then used to drive the conversion of adp to atp by phosphorylation ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' loading ', ' working ', ' loading playlists ']
