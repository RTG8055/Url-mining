u ve u done u our u homework u to u help u you u pick u the u toothbrush u that u s u right u for u you ', ' u all u the u models u here u will u get u your u teeth u squeaky u clean u but u they u vary u widely u in u terms u of u brushing u technology u battery u life u accessories u extra u functions u and u price u do u you u want u a u toothbrush u that u gives u detailed u real time u feedback u via u your u smartphone u do u you u want u a u choice u of u brush u heads u do u you u need u a u charging u travel u case u or u do u you u just u want u a u simple u model u that u gets u the u job u done u we u ve u got u them u all u covered u so u read u on u to u find u your u ideal u model ', ' u read u next u our u guide u to u the u best u hair u dryers u you u can u buy ', ' u an u electric u toothbrush u might u many u times u more u than u a u standard u human powered u brush u but u buying u a u good u one u can u dramatically u improve u the u quality u of u your u brushing u u u and u it ll u hopefully u stop u your u dentist u moaning u at u you u everytime u you u visit u too u these u are u all u the u features u and u functions u to u look u out u for u when u buying u a u new u brush ', ' u while u it u might u be u tempting u to u opt u for u the u cheapest u electric u toothbrush u you u can u find u not u all u are u created u equal u the u bottom rung u models u often u use u aa u batteries u and u while u being u able u to u use u your u own u replaceable u rechargeable u batteries u may u seem u like u a u more u practical u choice u these u low end u models u have u lower powered u motors u which u oscillate u at u a u much u slower u rate u than u ones u equipped u with u dedicated u non removable u batteries u u u this u means u that u their u brushing u performance u is u much u worse u than u models u with u more u powerful u motors u and u in u some u cases u you u may u be u better u off u with u a u standard u unpowered u toothbrush u than u a u cheap u electric u one u spending u more u on u a u model u with u a u dedicated u and u generally u non removable u battery u will u reward u with u much u improved u brushing u abilities ', ' u regardless u of u the u price u the u most u important u issue u is u how u well u they u brush u oral b u and u philips u are u the u market u leaders u and u we u found u that u u u at u least u amongst u the u brushes u we ve u reviewed u here u and u at u comparable u price u points u u u there u s u no u significant u difference u in u the u overall u quality u of u the u brushing u experience u between u the u two u brands ', ' u the u feel u of u the u two u brands u brushing u technology u couldn t u be u more u different u though u philips u using u tiny u extremely u fast u vibrations u that u feel u like u they u re u rattling u food u stains u and u plaque u off u your u teeth u oral b u uses u a u slightly u slower u larger u movement u and u the u toothbrush u head u rotates u rather u than u vibrates u both u systems u do u an u excellent u job u and u they u re u more u effective u than u manual u brushing u especially u for u hard to reach u areas u where u there u s u not u much u room u for u manoeuvre ', ' u more u upmarket u toothbrushes u also u include u various u extra u modes u such u as u whitening u gum u care u and u sensitive u but u most u of u these u only u vary u the u motor u speed u a u little u or u pulse u the u motor u speed u up u and u down u to u attempt u to u loosen u hard u to u reach u plaque u and u bits u of u food u we u don u t u see u these u as u must have u features u though u on u balance u we u prefer u oral b u s u approach u particularly u with u its u array u of u different u brush head u types u for u different u priorities u u u i e u reaching u between u teeth u or u polishing u more u effectively u u u but u that u s u a u subjective u rather u than u scientific u analysis ', ' u bundled u extras u such u as u travel u cases u do u come u in u handy u and u especially u so u if u the u toothbrush u can u be u charged u in u the u case u using u a u usb u cable u u u it u s u one u fewer u charger u to u carry ', ' u another u important u factor u is u whether u your u toothbrush u is u ready u to u use u when u you u need u it u it u s u no u use u if u the u battery u runs u out u regularly u and u without u warning u the u lithium ion u batteries u found u in u pricier u models u are u a u step u up u from u the u nickel metal u hydride u often u labelled u ni mh u ones u on u cheaper u brushes u u u this u is u because u the u lithium u ion u cells u as u they u can u be u topped u up u at u any u time u whereas u the u ni mh u ones u need u to u be u depleted u fully u before u charging u if u you u don t u want u to u reduce u their u lifespan u and u capacity ', ' u electric u toothbrushes u encourage u you u to u have u good u brushing u habits u letting u you u know u when u you u ve u completed u two u minutes u of u brushing u the u oral b u models u also u warn u you u when u you u re u pressing u too u hard u and u risking u damage u to u your u gums u thanks u to u leds u which u pulse u and u flash u when u you re u putting u too u much u pressure u on u your u gnashers ', ' u the u bluetooth enabled u models u go u further u still u by u adding u companion u apps u that u time u your u brushes u keep u a u diary u of u your u activity u provide u oral u hygiene u tips u and u snippets u of u news u and u make u you u feel u guilty u for u missing u brushes u not u flossing u enough u and u so u on u these u kind u of u features u are u fun u but u they re u by u no u means u essential u and u you u can u expect u the u novelty u to u wear u off u pretty u quickly u it s u also u highly u reliant u on u the u quality u of u the u apps u themselves u u u given u that u their u more u advanced u features u rely u on u your u smartphone u camera u to u track u where u and u how u you re u brushing u they u might u not u be u compatible u with u everyone s u brushing u techniques u if u you re u a u head down u brusher u or u just u like u to u roam u the u bathroom u while u polishing u your u gnashers u you ll u get u very u little u benefit u from u a u bluetooth connected u brush ', ' u this u can u be u a u confusing u experience u but u these u days u you ll u find u that u most u modern u philips u and u oral b u toothbrushes u make u buying u replacement u heads u a u relatively u simple u affair ', ' u all u of u oral b s u current u heads u work u on u their u entire u range u of u brushes u except u their u sonic u toothbrush u range u which u require u dedicated u sonic compatible u heads u as u oral b u makes u several u different u designs u of u head u however u it s u worth u buying u smaller u twin packs u to u decide u which u you u like u best u their u crossaction u flossaction u and u precisionclean u heads u all u feel u quite u different u in u use ', ' u philips u also u has u a u range u of u different u types u of u brush u head u each u with u their u own u specialist u designs u but u all u the u current u range u are u interchangeable u one u thing u worth u mentioning u is u that u you u can u also u find u mini sized u versions u of u
